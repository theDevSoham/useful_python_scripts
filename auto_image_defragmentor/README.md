# Auto Image Defragmentor

## A software for sorting images into folders based on their EXIF data (date taken)

<br />

---

# Purpose

<ul>
<li>This software is designed to sort images into folders based on their EXIF data (date taken).</li>

<li>It is designed to be used with a large number of images, and is therefore optimized for speed.</li>

<li>It is also designed to be used with images that have been taken with a camera that does not have a date/time stamp on the image itself, but rather stores the date/time in the EXIF data.</li>

<li>This is the case with most modern cameras, but not all. If your camera does not store the date/time in the EXIF data, this software will not work for you.</li>
</ul>
